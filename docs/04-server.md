# Server

The JSON server is written in Rust. It is using `axum` to create endpoints. It requires an access to the PostgreSQL database where the blocks and transactions have been stored.

## Configuration

Settings.toml
```
log_level = "info"

# Connection information for the PostgreSQL database
[database]
host = "localhost"
user = "postgres"
password = "wow"
dbname = "blockchain"


[server]
serve_at = "0.0.0.0"
port = 30303
```
